In mathematics, an integral equation is an equation in which an unknown function appears under an integral sign, which is different from differential equations where the unknown function appear in the form of its derivateves. A Fredholm equation is an integral equation in which the term containing the kernel function has constants as integration limits. A closely related form is the Volterra integral equation which has variable integral limits.

This code implements a new method called the "Gendi method" for the numerical solution of linear integral equations of Fredholm type in matlab. This method is not only more accurate but also much faster as shown in the video.
